## Hi there 👋 I'm Aditya 

Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm a data scientist first, who has evolved from data science to ML Engineering to AI. I currently lead the team that builds cloud native AI solutions at Wiser and participate on the AI steering committee committed to making AI more accessible across the organization.

I see myself as a leader at the intersection of AI/ML and software development. In previous lives, I've built pricing and promotions solutions at Loblaw Companies Ltd. and data solutions for industry leaders like Target and Kinaxis.

I've spent the last decade building ML platforms and leading engineering teams across healthcare and retail. The work spans everything from systems that crunch through millions of records daily to shaping enterprise AI strategies that actually move the needle on business outcomes.

## What Gets Me Excited

Building platforms that make it stupidly easy for teams to ship ML products. I've led cross-functional teams through the full lifecycle: model development, training infrastructure, deployment, monitoring, the whole nine yards.

I've learned that the technical stuff is table stakes. What really matters is building teams that work well together. I focus on fostering collaboration across engineering, data science, product, and operations because that's where the magic happens. When different perspectives come together to solve real problems, that's when you get breakthrough results.

The best platforms? They're invisible. Teams experiment, deploy, and iterate without thinking twice about the infrastructure underneath.

## What I Do

I lead AI/ML and Analytics engineering teams to build and scale production ML platforms that drive business impact. This means architecting production ML systems on AWS, defining enterprise AI adoption strategies, and building large-scale infrastructure for NLP, vector embeddings, LLMs, and agentic AI systems.

I'm responsible for end-to-end ML platform architecture, MLOps infrastructure, and enterprise AI strategy. Leading cross-functional teams spanning data science, ML engineering, front-end, and QA to deliver scalable solutions.

## Why I Share

This space is where I share my thoughts, experiences, and insights as someone who has witnessed the transformation of the data space from standalone analysis to notebooks to automated solutions to full-fledged AI workflows. As I lead teams and cultures to adopt modern solutions, I share my experiences, challenges, learnings, and insights here.

I'm not a developer by trade, but I've always been fascinated by the power of software and how it can transform the way we live and work. I believe AI and Machine Learning are the future of software development. I also believe the best way to learn is by doing, and this corner of the internet is a collection of my mistakes and learnings on this journey.
