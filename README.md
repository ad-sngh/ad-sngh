# Hey there, I'm Aditya

I'm a data scientist turned ML engineer leading cloud native AI solutions at Wiser. I've spent the last decade building ML platforms and leading engineering teams across healthcare and retail. I see myself as a leader at the intersection of AI and software development.

**What I do:** Build scalable ML platforms and infrastructure. Lead cross-functional teams through the full lifecycle from model development to deployment and monitoring. Define enterprise AI strategies and foster collaboration across engineering, data science, product, and operations.

**What excites me:** Platforms that make it stupidly easy for teams to ship ML products. The best ones are invisible, letting teams experiment and iterate without thinking about the infrastructure underneath.
